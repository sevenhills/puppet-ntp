Good morning, little boy; how do you do? Bring your little stool
 and sit down by me, for I have a great deal to tell you. I hope
 you have been a good boy, and read all the pretty words I 
wrote for you before. You have, you say; you have read them till 
you are tired, and you want some more new lessons. Come, then, 
sit down. Now you and I will tell stories.
